Thoughts on Version 1 of the Design
====================================

On the H side of Discow, we are not only looking at how annotations can support student learning. We are fundamentally concerned with how knowledge workers deal with information or knowledge. There are a long list of knowledge management software in this space. So we are doing a survey of available systems for (creative) knowledge work.

## Facets of the Design

### Annotate

Basic annotation process supported by H.

### Organize annotations to make them useful for knowledge work

- **Tags**: supported by current H. Metadata to make annotations more discoverable.
- **Epistemic markers** in an annotation: help students think about the annotated text.
- **Outline**: larger knowledge structure the annotation is made for. I want to come up with another name for this. Outline seems too rigid. "Big ideas"? *Idea magnets* that attracts annotations? I wish to help students think about an idea as a swarm, so annotations they make get attracted to larger ideas or knowledge structures. They can pretty much drag and drop annotations to magnets, which can be visualized as a group or as a list (in an Outliner). This is getting really interesting...

### Review and next-step actions

What's largely missing in existing annotation tools is the lack of support for further work empowered by annotations. Diigo is making progress recently in this regard. It used to be a personal library you keep dumping links and annotations into. Right now it adds an Outliner that you can use to organize your notes and share via a URL to someone else. DevonThink allows you to filter and port notes to a "Smart Group." This is also interesting.

But we may need stronger support for further actions taken on annotations. The Promising Ideas tool makes sense. But we needs better design. This part is something we need to think deeper in the Discow project.

- Where should review and reflection take place? In H or KF?
- How to support search and filtering?
- How knowledge gets moved across spaces while maintaining its original context? (We are essentially moving knowledge from a webpage, to H, and potentially to KF or other tools.)

To be continued...

## Related Projects

### Promising Ideas tool

Bodong programmed the tool in Knowledge Forum 4 and it's now implemented in KF6 as well. (It needs a refresh.)

### DevonThink (Mac)

- Databases: containing files; independent from each other
- Duplicate vs. Replicate: duplicates are independent; replicates are linked with each other
- Tags
  - Group tags and ordinary tags: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di3MlFLMOf4). DevonThink provides interesting ways to add tags, change tags, and make use of tags. The idea of filtering docs by tags and addign to a `smart group` is quite interesting and may apply to Discow very well.
- Labels
- Inbox: collecting information into DevonThink (global for all databases); can also be specific to databases
- Highlight notes

### Diigo

- Stripping away social features; keeping personal library and teams
- Outliner: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8yoSzn6Fp8)
  - quite interesting: basically another way to organize knowledge (in addition to tags)
  - drag and drop: 1) links; 2) highlights; to an outline
